# ArduinoTimer
I have used here AT mega 8a you can use any microcontroller. 
I have just modified the blink code to do my job.
Here I am using this for only turning a ligt on for 7 hours and for off for 17 hours.
You can just simply change the time using the equation.
If any thing didnt work, Please Email at <santarpanhatua@gmail.com>
